# Testing the Compute Environment on Casper and Other Systems
Please use the notebook [TestCasper.ipynb](TestCasper.ipynb) to make sure you're able to access NCAR's compute clusters and your user account has the correct access permissions to run relevant workshop compute jobs under the course's project ID **UCIS0004**. Registered workshop participants should have received details about their NCAR CIT account if a new user and established users should have had the prior project ID added to their account and now listed at [sam.ucar.edu](https://sam.ucar.edu).

To immediately start an interactive compute session with this notebook using your NCAR CIT account, please use this [nbgitpuller link](https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNCAR%2FGPU_workshop&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FGPU_workshop%2F00_TestCasper%2FTestCasper.ipynb&branch=CSG_tutorial) to open up an interactive JupyterHub session with this notebook in your browser. After logging with your credentials and DUO or 2-Factor Authentication device, choose "Casper login node" under the "Cluster Selection" pulldown.

If you have any questions, problems running this notebook, or issues accessing the compute cluster, please reach out to workshop organizers over email or the [NCAR GPU Users Slack](https://ncargpuusers.slack.com).
