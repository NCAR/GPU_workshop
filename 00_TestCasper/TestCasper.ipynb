    "# Testing the Casper Compute Environment and Running a GPU Program\n",
    "\n",
    "By: Daniel Howard, March 14th, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a test notebook for NCAR's GPU Computing Workshop series to make sure your user account is setup appropriately and demonstrate simple GPU program examples on NCAR's [Casper computing cluster](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549550). You may also run this notebook on other personal machines or HPC clusters but minimal support will be provided in this case. To initialize and run this notebook on Casper: \n",
    "1. Start a Jupyter Hub session via the **[NCAR JupyterHub portal](https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/)**\n",
    "2. For this notebook, choose \"**Casper login node**\" under the \"Cluster Selection\" pulldown.\n",
    "3. **Navigate to the folder** you'd prefer to save the GPU workshop github repo (Default is your `$HOME` folder)\n",
    "4. Select the **git icon** (diamond square below Dask icon) on the side panel at the left side of the browser window\n",
    "5. Select \"**Clone a Repository**\" \n",
    "6. Enter this git repository address **`https://github.com/dphow/GPU_workshop.git`**\n",
    "7. Navigate into the newly cloned `GPU_workshop` directory and select the file **`TestCasper.ipynb`** in the folder `00_TestCasper`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have this notebook displayed and running under the Bash kernel (check active kernel in top right of window), then run each code cell below in order by selecting the cell and pressing CTRL+ENTER. Please report if there are any issues or concerns to workshop organizers or reach out via the [NCAR GPU Users Slack](ncargpuusers.slack.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "For all registered workshop users, your provided NCAR CIT account should have permissions to use the **UCIS0004** project below. Please use this project ID to charge your compute jobs when running work on Casper. You may use this ID for small workshop related learning work on the order of 30 minutes walltime or less, ideally less than 5 minutes. However, no production scale jobs should be submitted using this project's allocation as it is meant to be shared across the full GPU workshop learning community. If you'd like to request your own allocation for more compute intensive work, please reference the [Allocations documentation](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/74317835). For student and early career faculty university users, there are [opportunities available](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/75694351) for small one-time allocation rewards for unsponsored work, typically to enable dissertation research or provide seed grants towards funded research.\n",

    "Please run the below cell to initialize the workshop Project ID (or your own Project ID) for later cells."

    "First, we are going to submit a job on Casper's PBS job scheduler to run some simple work on a GPU node. To submit jobs, we are going to use the `qsub` and `qcmd` command. You can learn more about `qsub` and other options for submitting compute jobs to Casper's HPC cluster, including GPUs, at the documentation portal at [arc.ucar.edu - Starting Casper Jobs with PBS](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581396).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now display info about the GPUs on Casper. This is achieved by two commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nvaccelinfo` - Displays static information about all currently connected GPUs. Available under the NVHPC SDK.\n",
    "* `nvidia-smi` - Displays dynamic information about all currently connected GPUs. Able to achieve more detailed queries of the GPU state by referencing options available via the command's help text with `nvidia-smi -h`. Available with both the CUDA Toolkit and the NVHPC SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, jobs are submitted to Casper and Cheyenne via batch scripts like this pre-configured script [batch_accelinfo.sh](batch_accelinfo.sh) and the command `qsub batch_accelinfo.sh`. These scripts contains header information for the PBS job scheduler to interpret and determine how to place jobs across the supercomputing cluster. However, here we will use a custom wrapper script `qcmd` for simple executables which submits `qsub` jobs that redirects output directly back to the terminal. Try out `qcmd` in the below cells to see output from the `nvaccelinfo` and `nvidia-smi` commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running on a local GPU enabled machine or are already running interactively on a GPU node, expand and run the hidden cell (click the ellipse ...). Otherwise, please keep in mind it is best to run on the `gpudev` queue (30 minute jobs or less for development, profiling, and debug purposes) during the weekday from 8am to 6:30pm MT. If you are running this outside working hours, edit `-q gpudev` to instead `-q casper` which is shared amongst all Casper users and production jobs. Delays to access GPUs will depend on current availability and intensity of your compute reource request."
