    "Set the `PROJECT` code to a currently active project, ie `UCIS0004` for the GPU workshop, and `QUEUE` to the appropriate routing queue depending on if during a live workshop session (`gpuworkshop`), during weekday 8am to 5:30pm MT (`gpudev`), or all other times (`casper`). Due to limited shared GPU resources, please use `GPU_TYPE=gp100` during the workshop. Otherwise, set `GPU_TYPE=v100` (required for `gpudev`) for independent work. See [Casper queue documentation](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/72581396#StartingCasperjobswithPBS-Concurrentresourcelimits) for more info.  "
