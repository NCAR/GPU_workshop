# The Co-Design Process for Scientists and Project Leads

[The Co-Design Process for Scientists and Project Leads](16_CoDesign.pdf) is the sixteenth and final workshop in this series and was presented by John Dennis (CISL's Application Scalability and Performance Group) on September 8th. The video recording for this session will be uploaded here. Topics covered include:

* Questions scientists and project leads can ask to determine if their science objectives and applications are suitable for GPU acceleration.
* Co-design strategies to help scientists and engineers work together and maintain code stability while achieving science goals.
