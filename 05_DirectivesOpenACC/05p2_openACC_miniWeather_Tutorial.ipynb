    "## Advanced Optimizations with `cache`, `tile`, and `gang/worker/vector` Clauses\n",
    "The compiler typically does a good job choosing close to optimal arrangements of `gang`, `worker`, and `vector` parallel execution. You can review compiler choices in `-Minfo=accel` output, basic profiling via `NVCOMPILER_ACC_TIME=1`, or NSight Systems/Compute profiling. However, further optimization can be explored by manualy specifying optimization parameters. __This process requires significant experimentation with some intuition__. Clauses not previously discussed are detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cache()` - When included inside and at the top of a loop, specifies array elements or subarrays that should be fetched into the highest level of cache, ie the shared memory of the SM assigned to each gang.\n",
    "* `tile(n,m,...)` - Splits loops into two loops, outer _tile_ loops and inner _element_ loops. Listed integer arguments specify the size of each tile and correspond to each tightly nested loop. The first `n` corresponds to the innermost loop. If `n`=`*`, the compiler has freedom to choose tile size.\n",
    "    * A `vector` clause is applied to _element_ loops \n",
    "    * A `gang` clause is applied to _tile_ loops\n",
    "    * A `worker` clause is applied to _element_ loops or to _tile_ loops if the `vector` clause is also present"

    "If you have a an array or subarray of data to be accessed frequently within a compute kernel, the `cache()` directive can direct the compiler to keep that portion of memory nearby in a fast L1 shared memory cache for each gang. The size of this cache is limited and dependent on the hardware (V100 - 96kB, A100 - 160kB) but can increase performance if configured correctly. Example below:\n",
